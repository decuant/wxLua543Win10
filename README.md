# wxLua542Win10
Windows 10.0.14393.0 compiled binaries for Lua 5.4.3, wxWidgets-3.1.5, wxLua 3.1.0.0

I have included everything comes out of the compiling process, 32 and 64 bits.

For installation instructions have a look here: https://github.com/decuant/wxLua535Win10

Just be careful to use the right names (i.e. 543 instead of 535).

Have fun with Lua!!!
